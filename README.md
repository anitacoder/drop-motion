# DROP Motion

# Overview

** This is an interactive desktop application that leverages **AI-powered hand gesture recognition** to enable intuitive, touchless drag-and-drop functionality. By tracking the user's **index** and **middle finger** movements using a webcam, the app detects a "pinch" gesture to initiate drag and a "release" to drop — simulating standard mouse interactions without physical contact.
